## Setup Instructions

These instructions will guide you through setting up the necessary Python environment to run this project.

**Prerequisites:**
*   Python 3.8 or higher installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
*   `pip` (Python package installer), which usually comes with Python.
*   Git installed (for cloning the repository).
*   **Tesseract OCR Engine:** This project uses Tesseract for offline OCR attempts. You need to install the Tesseract engine itself (not just the Python wrapper).
    *   **Windows:** Download and run the installer from [UB Mannheim Tesseract releases](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki). **During installation, ensure you select the option to "Add Tesseract to system PATH" and include at least the "English" language data.**
    *   **Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):** `sudo apt update && sudo apt install tesseract-ocr tesseract-ocr-eng`
    *   **macOS:** `brew install tesseract tesseract-lang` (the latter installs all language packs)
    *   After installing, you may need to restart your terminal or computer. Verify by opening a new terminal and typing `tesseract --version`.

**Steps:**

1.  **Clone the Repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone [URL_OF_YOUR_GIT_REPOSITORY]
    cd [PROJECT_DIRECTORY_NAME] 
    ```
    (Replace `[URL_OF_YOUR_GIT_REPOSITORY]` and `[PROJECT_DIRECTORY_NAME]`)

2.  **Create a Python Virtual Environment:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to keep project dependencies isolated. Navigate to the project's root directory (e.g., where `Silver_detection.py` is located) in your terminal and run:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    This command creates a new directory named `venv` (you can name it differently if you prefer) which will contain the Python interpreter and libraries for this project.

3.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    *   **Windows (PowerShell):**
        ```powershell
        .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```
        (If you encounter an execution policy error, you might need to run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process` in PowerShell first for the current session.)
    *   **Windows (Command Prompt - cmd.exe):**
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```
    *   **macOS / Linux (bash/zsh):**
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    After activation, your terminal prompt should be prefixed with `(venv)`.

4.  **Install Required Python Packages:**
    With the virtual environment active, install all the necessary libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    This command will read the `requirements.txt` file and install all the listed packages and their specific versions into your `venv`. This might take a few minutes as it downloads and installs packages like PyTorch, TensorFlow (if it were a dependency), Transformers, etc.

5.  **Offline Model Downloads (First Run):**
    The first time you run the main application (`Silver_detection.py`), it will download pre-trained models for YOLO object detection and BLIP image captioning if they are not already cached on your system. This initial download requires an internet connection. Subsequent runs will use the locally cached models.
    *   YOLO models are usually cached by the `ultralytics` library.
    *   Hugging Face Transformers models (like BLIP) are typically cached in `~/.cache/huggingface/hub/` (Linux/macOS) or `C:\Users\<YourUser>\.cache\huggingface\hub\` (Windows).

6.  **Configuration (If Needed):**
    *   **Tesseract Path (ocr_module.py):** If `pytesseract` cannot find your Tesseract installation (even if it's in PATH), you might need to manually set the path to `tesseract.exe` within the `ocr_module.py` file. Look for the line:
        ```python
        # pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe' 
        ```
        Uncomment it and adjust the path if necessary for your system.

7.  **Running the Application:**
    Once everything is set up, you can run the main script:
    ```bash
    python Silver_detection.py
    ```

**Deactivating the Virtual Environment:**
When you're done working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment by simply typing:
```bash
deactivate
